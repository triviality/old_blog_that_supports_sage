This blog is powered by 

- [**SageMath**](http://www.sagemath.org/){:target="_blank"}, 
- the [Sage Cell Server](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/){:target="_blank"},  and
- [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll){:target="_blank"} + [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}, based on a theme from [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com){:target="_blank"}.

It's my collection of SageMath code that can be run directly in your browser.

Read more [about the Sage Cell Server](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/static/about.html){:target="_blank"}, including how to embed executable Sage code into your website. Or [fork](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#quick-start){:target="_blank"} this  [repository](https://github.com/sheaves/sheaves.github.io){:target="_blank"} on Github to get started right away! 

To get even more out of SageMath (fancy stuff like privacy settings, collaboration, organizing courses, your own Linux server etc.), sign up for a free [**SageMath Cloud**](https://cloud.sagemath.com/){:target="_blank"} account! You can also [download and run a local copy](http://www.sagemath.org/download.html){:target="_blank"} of SageMath.
